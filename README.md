# Line and Bar Grades

For this activity, you’ll take on the role of the teacher as you create bar and line graphs to visualize your class’s grades over a semester.

## Instructions

* Create a series of bar graphs that visualize the grades of all students in the class, with one graph for every month.

* Create a line graph using all available data to compare students' grades over the semester.

  * Use filtering in the line graph to drill down to an individual student’s performance.
